    <p>The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel. Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more
        formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: "A computer program is said to learn
        from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in
        T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is
        concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This
        follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which the question "Can
        machines think?" is replaced with the question "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?". In
        Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various
        implications in constructing one are exposed.</p>

    <h3>Machine learning tasks</h3>


    <p> A support vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear
        boundary. Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white.
        Machine learning tasks are classified into several broad categories. In supervised learning, the algorithm
        builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. For
        example, if the task were determining whether an image contained a certain object, the training data for a
        supervised learning algorithm would include images with and without that object (the input), and each image
        would have a label (the output) designating whether it contained the object. In special cases, the input may be
        only partially available, or restricted to special feedback.[clarification needed] Semi-supervised learning
        algorithms develop mathematical models from incomplete training data, where a portion of the sample input
        doesn't have labels.

        algorithms and regression algorithms are types of supervised learning. Classification algorithms are used when
        the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values. For a classification algorithm that filters emails, the
        input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. For
        an algorithm that identifies spam emails, the output would be the prediction of either "spam" or "not spam",
        represented by the Boolean values true and false. Regression algorithms are named for their continuous outputs,
        meaning they may have any value within a range. Examples of a continuous value are the temperature, length, or
        price of an object.

        In unsupervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data which contains only
        inputs and no desired output labels. Unsupervised learning algorithms are used to find structure in the data,
        like grouping or clustering of data points. Unsupervised learning can discover patterns in the data, and can
        group the inputs into categories, as in feature learning. Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing
        the number of "features", or inputs, in a set of data.

        Active learning algorithms access the desired outputs (training labels) for a limited set of inputs based on a
        budget, and optimize the choice of inputs for which it will acquire training labels. When used interactively,
        these can be presented to a human user for labeling. Reinforcement learning algorithms are given feedback in the
        form of positive or negative reinforcement in a dynamic environment, and are used in autonomous vehicles or in
        learning to play a game against a human opponent.[2]:3 Other specialized algorithms in machine learning include
        topic modeling, where the computer program is given a set of natural language documents and finds other
        documents that cover similar topics. Machine learning algorithms can be used to find the unobservable
        probability density function in density estimation problems. Meta learning algorithms learn their own inductive
        bias based on previous experience. In developmental robotics, robot learning algorithms generate their own
        sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through
        self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans. These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active
        learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation.</p>
