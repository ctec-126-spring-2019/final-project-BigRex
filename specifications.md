##Specifications:


The goal of this project is to demonstrate client-side Machine Learning using
the [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/) JavaScript library. It will
allow the user to choose from one of three datasets, the size of the training
set, then present the results of from the learning with a graphically rich and
textural report.

The project will have a strong educational focus, giving the user insight on
what Machine learning is, how it is performed, and what can be learned from the
Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning approach to data processing. The
datasets will come from the [UCI Machine Learning
Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) or data that I’ve
generated on my own. This part I’m not sure about yet. Ideally, the datasets for
this project this project should be in a database on a server somewhere and
processed on the server side with the user getting the report of the results on
the client side. However, that is beyond the scope of this class and my skillset
to complete in three weeks. Thus, the datasets will be local to the project,
either in a folder named “datasets” or on a localhost.

The layout of the pages will use Bootstrap. Graphics will be generated with the
[tfjs-vis](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-vis) library.

__Personal Note:__ The reason for attempting a project this complex gives me an
opportunity to do what I wanted to get out of my CTEC AAT. The development of
interesting ways to present difficult big data concepts to the user.

*   Landing Page: The landing page will be a description of the project and the
    process including thumbnails of the graphics.

*   About Page: The about page will be a blog post type of page focusing on
    definitions and a history Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

*   Processing Page: The processing page will be broken down into two sections.
    First, a description of the chosen dataset and what we will learn by
    processing it. The second section will be training the data in real time to
    give us an answer to a question with the chosen dataset.
