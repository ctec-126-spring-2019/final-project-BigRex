# Milestone #2

## The submitted code:
The code in this repository is very shaky and it really couldn’t be considered to have been half finished.

*However, is should give a good idea where I am taking this project.*

## The current plan
The plan is to take three different datasets acquired from video sources, find a frame in the data and display a picture from the machine learned data. I have already made images from the data that I’m using in Python, so a good portion of the imaging heavy lifting is finished. The tough part of this project will be figuring out how to teach TensorFlow how to find individual scan lines and then build an array that can be displayed as an image. The example page gives a very coarse idea what I’m planning to do and what I think I can deliver.

I’m sure you have a whole bunch of doubts of my mental stability, but this is what I want to try to pull off and I’m fairly optimistic that I can.
