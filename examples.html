            <h3>Visualizing training with tfjs-vis</h3>

            <section>
                <p>
                    tfjs-vis is a small set of visualization utilities to make it easier to understand what is going on
                    with your
                    tfjs models.
                    It is designed in a way to work along side regular web apps. This page will use some of the features
                    of tfjs to
                    illustrate
                    what is going on with a convolutional model that will be trained (in the browser) to recognize
                    handwritten
                    digits.

                </p>
                <h4 style="color:gold">
                    Note: I won't be using the MNIST database in the final deliverable although we are using the MNIST
                    dataset for this example.
                </h4>

                <p>
                    tfjs-vis provides 2 main things:
                    <ol>
                        <li>A place to put visualizations that tries not to interfere with your web page. We call this
                            place a
                            <em>visor.</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>Some built in visualizations that we have found to be useful when working with TensorFlow.js
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4 style="color:gold">Another note: you have to click the buttons in order to see what is going on.<h4>
                        <h4>The Visor</h4>
                        <p>
                            Let's take a look at the first. Calling <code>tfvis.visor()</code> will create a visor if it
                            doesn't
                            exist or
                            return
                            the existing one. Click the button below to show the
                            <em>visor.</em>
                        </p>
                        <button id="show-visor">Show Visor</button>
                        <p>
                            Notice the panel that is now displayed on the right. It hovers over your pages content and
                            shouldn't
                            disturb
                            the flow of
                            your page's DOM Elements. You can see a few controls for showing or hiding the visor, but by
                            default
                            it also
                            supports
                            the following keyboard shortcuts:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>`</strong> (backtick): Shows or hides the visor</li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>~</strong> (tilde, shift+backtick): Toggles betweeen the two sizes the visor
                                    supports</li>
                            </ul>
                            The API allows you to disable (unbind) these keyboard shortcuts.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Surfaces</h4>
                        <p>
                            To add content to the visor we need a
                            <em>surface</em>. We make a surface with the following function call:
                           <!--  <script type="text" class="show-script">
                  tfVis.visor().surface({name: 'My First Surface', tab: 'Input Data'});
                </script> -->
                        </p>
                        <button id="make-first-surface">Make a surface</button>
                        <p>
                            To create a surface we must give is a name, we can also optionally specify a tab name that
                            the
                            surface should
                            be put on.
                            <code>visor().surface()</code> allows us to create a surface if it doesn't exist or fetch it
                            if it
                            does. This
                            API
                            returns an object that has a pointer to 3 DOM elements:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>container:</strong> The containing DOM element for the surface</li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>label:</strong> The label element </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>drawArea:</strong> A DOM Element where we can render visualizations or other
                                    content.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
            </section>

                <h4>Our Data</h4>
                <p>
                    I will provide data for three different training sessions. It is data that I captured several years
                    ago but it will be a good test for TensorFlow.
                    The data is three different images captured as video signals, which we will apply Machine Learning
                    techniques to and ultimately display a Machine Learned image found in the data.
                    The image below is an example of one video scan line. TensorFlow will have to find the pattern of
                    the scan line and build an array that will display a picture on the page.
                </p>

                <div id="show-examples" disabled=""></div>

                <p>
                    The code to render these examples isn't built into tfjs. But because you have full access to the DOM
                    element
                    for each surface,
                    you can draw whatever you would like into them. This allows easy integration of custom
                    visualizations into the
                    visor.

                <h3>Training Our Model</h3>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to build a fram from video signals using Machine Learning.  The example below is a real time example of the MNIST data being learned in real time.
                </p>

                <p>First let us define a helper function to do our training.</p>

                <script class="show-script">async function train(model, data, fitCallbacks) {
                        const BATCH_SIZE = 64;
                        const trainDataSize = 500;
                        const testDataSize = 100;
                        const [trainXs, trainYs] = tf.tidy(() => {
                            const d = data.nextTrainBatch(trainDataSize);
                            return [d.xs.reshape([trainDataSize, 28, 28, 1]), d.labels];
                        });
                        const [testXs, testYs] = tf.tidy(() => {
                            const d = data.nextTestBatch(testDataSize);
                            return [d.xs.reshape([testDataSize, 28, 28, 1]), d.labels];
                        });
                        return model.fit(trainXs, trainYs, {
                            batchSize: BATCH_SIZE,
                            validationData: [testXs, testYs],
                            epochs: 10,
                            shuffle: true,
                            callbacks: fitCallbacks
                        });
                    }</script>

                <p>
                    We can use the <code>show.fitCallbacks</code> method to get functions that will plot the loss after
                    every batch
                    and
                    epoch.
                </p>

                <button id="start-training-1" disabled="">Start Training</button>

                <script
                    class="show-script">async function watchTraining() {
                            const metrics = ['loss', 'val_loss', 'acc', 'val_acc'];
                            const container = {
                                name: 'show.fitCallbacks',
                                tab: 'Training',
                                styles: {
                                    height: '1000px'
                                }
                            };
                            const callbacks = tfvis.show.fitCallbacks(container, metrics);
                            return train(model, data, callbacks);
                        }

                        document.querySelector('#start-training-1').addEventListener('click', () => watchTraining());</script>

                <p>
                    Another option is to wait for the training to complete and render the loss curve when it is done.
